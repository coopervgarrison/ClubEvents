# ClubEvents

Our project is basically a companion app for AnchorLink. AnchorLink holds all the information about the hundreds of Registered 
Student Orgs and their registered events on campus. As many students access their calendars on their phones, we decided to make
an app that could display all the information from AnchorLink on their phone. Our app lets users log-in, view orgs, view events,
and the calendar.

Our biggest challenges we faced during implementation revolved around working with Android Studio. We had trouble connecting 
our PostGreSQL database to the app/server. We decided to create a class in our app with the intended functionality or methods
our app would use. We also tried reading in text files instead of having a living database, but also had trouble reading and
storing that information. We also had challenges in using buttons in Android Studio, so we circumvented the problem with
Expandable Lists.
